File Structure: 
Coding for part 1.2, 2.2, and 2.3 were all done in java.
They are named according to the parts.

For the file output of 1.2, the program writes to a csv file, OutputText21.csv and OutputImagept21.csv
For part 2.3, I have outputted it to the file LogData.csv

One thing to note for generating output is that for 1.2, the directory may need to be changed according to where the input file is.

The R code is titled rCode, and generates all the tables and graphing, after loading in the appropriate input file.

The Report pdf file is for the report.
